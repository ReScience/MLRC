abstract: "This work describes the reproduction and extended study on the work titled \"Improving Multi-hop Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs using Knowledge Base Embeddings\" (EmbedKGQA) published in ACL2020, as part of the ML Reproducibility Challenge 2020. Our work consists of four parts: (1) Reproducing results EmbedKGQA (2) Adding more experiments by
replacing the knowledge graph embedding method (3) and exploring the question embedding method using various
transformer models (4) Verifying the importance of Relation Matching (RM) module. Based on the code shared by
the authors, we have reproduced the results for the EmbedKGQA method. We have not purposely performed relation
matching to validate point-4."
