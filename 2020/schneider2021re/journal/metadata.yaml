abstract: "The presented study evaluates 'Satellite Image Time Series Classification with Pixel-Set Encoders and Temporal Self-Attention' by Garnot et al. (2020) within the scope of the ML Reproducibility Challenge 2020. Our work focuses on both aspects constituting the paper: the method itself and the validity of the stated results. We show that, despite some unforeseen design choices, the investigated method is coherent in itself and performs the expected way."
