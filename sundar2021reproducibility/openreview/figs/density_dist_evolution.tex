    \caption{\textbf{Effect of redistribution on \textit{RigL}'s performance,} evaluated using WideResNet-22-2 on CIFAR10 at 80\% sparsity. \textbf{(left)} FLOPs required per forward pass, shown relative to the dense baseline, rises quickly and saturates within a few epochs (\textasciitilde10k steps) for both sparse gradient and sparse momentum based redistribution. \textbf{(right)} Comparison of the final density distribution against Random and ERK counterparts. ``b'' refers to block and ``l'' layer here.}
