\section*{Broader Impact}
Recent researches \citet{r3} mention that training a single big transformer model could emit around 626,155 lbs CO\textsubscript{2} which is around 5 times of average carbon emission by a car in its total lifetime. Clearly, Deep Learning takes a huge toll on the environment which is why there has been an increased focus on much more energy-efficient "Green AI". BNNs intrinsically have far less computational and space complexity as compared to their full-precision counterparts and as we can see above they can also achieve accuracy close to the full-precision networks, at least in the classification tasks, and also show the potential of expanding well to more complex segmentation tasks. This can help us a lot in moving towards cleaner Deep Learning. This field of research also provides a huge set of opportunities in extending AI to edge devices with much smaller and low-energy systems. We feel that its potential impact on the environment and sustainability is at par with its academic importance.
