\section{Scope of reproducibility}
The paper mentions a bayesian approach to solve the discrete optimization problem in the case of Binary Neural Networks (BNNs). The outcome of this approach was a BayesBiNN optimizer which could be used to train BNNs and achieve similar accuracy as compared to their full-precision counterparts. To verify the claims given in the paper, we target to achieve the following objectives:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Work out and present the mathematics behind BayesBiNN in a simpler way and prepare a pseudo-code to the optimizer.
    \item Implement the BayesBiNN optimizer and STE optimizer to verify the accuracy on tasks of varying domains, as reported in the original paper.
    \item Reproduce the results for other baselines present in the paper such as proximal mean-field (PMF) according to the hyper-parameters given in the paper.
    \item Evaluate the performance of BayesBiNN optimizer in more complex domains like semantic segmentation.
\end{itemize}
