    Illustration of the architectural difference between \subref{fig:tae_transformer_garnot} the proposed temporal attention encoder and \subref{fig:tae_transformer_Adapted} the extended version of it presented in this study.
    While \citeauthor{Garnot20:SIT} approached satellite image time series classification with a lightweight adaption of the Transformer architecture \parencite{Vaswani17:Attention}, we kept the original third fully-connected layer $\FC_v$.
    The additional building blocks of the surveyed method---namely the encoder, positional encoding, attention, and final $\MLP$---remained unchanged.
    This schematic representation does not include the multi-head attention, which mainly influences the \emph{attention} module and would increase the complexity unnecessarily.

    While the blue areas are used to evaluate the train and test procedure proposed by \citeauthor{Garnot20:SIT}, the yellow area was set aside in advance.
    This way, we ensured to have an extra regionally differentiated test set that does not suffer from the issue of spatial autocorrelation.

      This shows that training and testing on the SI-\tilename{T33TWM} while using the top-20-F labels will lead to fewer classes in total.

    Statistics on the different datasets used in this study. 
    As the data harmonisation was done by hand, the class names of one dataset might include differently named crop types from the other dataset and vice versa. 
    We point out that the relative occurrence is indicated in $\log$-scale, highlighting the strong class imbalance towards meadow.
