  abstract = 	 {Sampling methods that choose a subset of the data proportional to its diversity in the feature space are popular for data summarization. However, recent studies have noted the occurrence of bias {–} e.g., under or over representation of a particular gender or ethnicity {–} in such data summarization methods. In this paper we initiate a study of the problem of outputting a diverse and fair summary of a given dataset. We work with a well-studied determinantal measure of diversity and corresponding distributions (DPPs) and present a framework that allows us to incorporate a general class of fairness constraints into such distributions. Designing efficient algorithms to sample from these constrained determinantal distributions, however, suffers from a complexity barrier; we present a fast sampler that is provably good when the input vectors satisfy a natural property. Our empirical results on both real-world and synthetic datasets show that the diversity of the samples produced by adding fairness constraints is not too far from the unconstrained case.}

  abstract = 	 {There is growing awareness and concern about fairness in machine learning and algorithm design. This is particularly true in online selection problems where decisions are often biased, for example, when assessing credit risks or hiring staff. We address the issues of fairness and bias in online selection by introducing multi-color versions of the classic secretary and prophet problem. Interestingly, existing algorithms for these problems are either very unfair or very inefficient, so we develop optimal fair algorithms for these new problems and provide tight bounds on their competitiveness. We validate our theoretical findings on real-world data.}

abstract = "The classic prophet inequality states that, when faced with a finite sequence of non-negative independent random variables, a gambler who knows their distribution and is allowed to stop the sequence at any time, can obtain, in expectation, at least half as much reward as a prophet who knows the values of each random variable and can choose the largest one. In this work we consider the situation in which the sequence comes in random order. We look at both a non-adaptive and an adaptive version of the problem. In the former case the gambler sets a threshold for every random variable a priori, while in the latter case the thresholds are set when a random variable arrives. For the non-adaptive case, we obtain an algorithm achieving an expected reward within at least a 1-1/e fraction of the expected maximum and prove this constant is optimal. For the adaptive case with i.i.d. random variables, we obtain a tight 0.745-approximation, solving a problem posed by Hill and Kertz in 1982.We also apply these prophet inequalities to posted price mechanisms, and prove the same tight bounds for both a non-adaptive and an adaptive posted price mechanism when buyers arrive in random order.",

A recent focus has been on developing fair versions of classical algorithms, such as those for bandit learning, regression, and clustering. In this work we extend this line of work to include algorithms for optimization subject to one or multiple matroid constraints. We map out a series of results, showing optimal solutions, approximation algorithms, and hardness proofs depending on the specific flavor of the problem. Our algorithms are efficient and empirical experiments demonstrate that fairness can be achieved with a modest compromise to the overall objective value.}
