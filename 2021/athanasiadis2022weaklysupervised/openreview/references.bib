abstract="Layer-wise relevance propagation is a framework which allows to decompose the prediction of a deep neural network computed over a sample, e.g. an image, down to relevance scores for the single input dimensions of the sample such as subpixels of an image. While this approach can be applied directly to generalized linear mappings, product type non-linearities are not covered. This paper proposes an approach to extend layer-wise relevance propagation to neural networks with local renormalization layers, which is a very common product-type non-linearity in convolutional neural networks. We evaluate the proposed method for local renormalization layers on the CIFAR-10, Imagenet and MIT Places datasets.",

title = "ImageNet Auto-Annotation with Segmentation Propagation",
abstract = "ImageNet is a large-scale hierarchical database of object classes with millions of images. We propose to automatically populate it with pixelwise object-background segmentations, by leveraging existing manual annotations in the form of class labels and bounding-boxes. The key idea is to recursively exploit images segmented so far to guide the segmentation of new images. At each stage this propagation process expands into the images which are easiest to segment at that point in time, e.g. by moving to the semantically most related classes to those segmented so far. The propagation of segmentation occurs both (a) at the image level, by transferring existing segmentations to estimate the probability of a pixel to be foreground, and (b) at the class level, by jointly segmenting images of the same class and by importing the appearance models of classes that are already segmented. Through experiments on 577 classes and 500k images we show that our technique (i) annotates a wide range of classes with accurate segmentations; (ii) effectively exploits the hierarchical structure of ImageNet; (iii) scales efficiently, especially when implemented on superpixels; (iv) outperforms a baseline GrabCut (Rother et al. 2004) initialized on the image center, as well as segmentation transfer from a fixed source pool and run independently on each target image (Kuettel and Ferrari 2012). Moreover, our method also delivers state-of-the-art results on the recent iCoseg dataset for co-segmentation.",

abstract={The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge is a benchmark in object category classification and detection on hundreds of object categories and millions of images. The challenge has been run annually from 2010 to present, attracting participation from more than fifty institutions. This paper describes the creation of this benchmark dataset and the advances in object recognition that have been possible as a result. We discuss the challenges of collecting large-scale ground truth annotation, highlight key breakthroughs in categorical object recognition, provide a detailed analysis of the current state of the field of large-scale image classification and object detection, and compare the state-of-the-art computer vision accuracy with human accuracy. We conclude with lessons learned in the 5 years of the challenge, and propose future directions and improvements.},
