% Three years, we launched ReScience, a new scientific journal aimed at publishing the
% replication of existing computational research. Since ReScience published its first
% article\supercite{Topalidou:2015}, things have been
% going steadily. We are still alive, independent and without a budget. In the
% meantime, we have published around 24 articles (mostly in computational
% neuroscience \& computational ecology) and the initial
% \href{https://rescience-c.github.io/board/}{editorial board} has grown from
% around 10 to roughly 100 members (editors and reviewers), we have advertised
% ReScience at several conferences worldwide, gave some
% interviews\supercite{Science:2018}, and published an article introducing
% ReScience in PeerJ~CS\supercite{Rougier:2017}. Based on our
% experience\supercite{Rougier:2018} at managing the journal during these three
% years, we think that time is ripe for some changes.

% \subsubsection{ReScience C \& ReScience X}

% The biggest and most visible change we would like to propose is to change the
% name of the journal ``ReScience'' in favor of ``ReScience C'' where the C
% stands for (c)omputational. This change would be necessary to have consistent
% naming with the upcoming creation of the ``ReScience X'' journal that will be
% dedicated to e(x)perimental replications and co-directed by E.Roesch
% (University of Reading) and N.Rougier (University of Bordeaux). The name
% ``ReScience'' would then be used for the name of a non-profit organization
% (that is yet to be created) for the two journals as well as future journals
% (such as the utopian CoScience\supercite{Rougier:2017} or a future and
% tentative ``ReScience T'' for theoretical science).


% \subsubsection{A new submission process}

% The current submission process requires authors to fork, clone and branch the
% submission repository in order to write their article and to place code and
% data at the relevant places in the forked repository. Once done, authors have
% to push their changes and to make a pull request that is considered as a
% submission. This process is cumbersome for authors and has induced many
% troubles for editors as well once the article is accepted and ready to be
% published, mostly because of the complexity of the editing procedure. In order
% to make life easier for everyone, we greatly simplified the submission process
% for ReScience C and X. Authors are now responsible for getting a DOI for their
% code \& data and only have to submit a PDF and a metadata file in a GitHub
% issue.
% We also provide Python programs that largely automate the subsequent editing
% process. We will still archive the submission on Zenodo but this archive will
% be made for the final PDF only. However, both the PDF and the Zenodo entry will
% contain all associated DOIs (data and code).


% \subsubsection{A simplified publishing process}

% In ReScience, we have have been using a combination of
% \href{https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax}{markdown} and
% \href{http://pandoc.org/}{pandoc} for producing both the draft and the final
% version of all the published articles. This had worked reasonably well until it
% started to cause all kind of problems for both authors and editors, especially
% with the reference and citation plugins. Consequently, articles will be now
% submitted directly in PDF with accompanying metadata in a separate file using
% the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML}{YAML} format (they were
% previously embedded in the markdown file). Once an article has been accepted,
% authors will be responsible for updating the metadata and for rebuilding the PDF if
% necessary. We could also consider using the
% \href{https://github.com/openjournals/whedon}{Whedon} API that helps with automating
% most of the editorial tasks for \href{http://joss.theoj.org/}{JOSS} and
% \href{http://jose.theoj.org/}{JOSE}. This will most probably require some
% tweaking because our publishing pipeline is a bit different.


% \subsubsection{A new design}

% The combination of markdown and pandoc has also severely limited the layout and
% style possibilities for the article template and since we are switching to
% \LaTeX, this is the opportunity to propose a new design based on a more elegant
% style, using a new font stack\supercite{SourceSerifPro:2014, Roboto:2011,
%   SourceCodePro:2012} (you are currently reading it). The goal is to have a
% subtle but strong identity with enhanced readability. Considering that articles
% will be mostly read on screen (as opposed to printed), we can benefit from a
% more ethereal style. Once this design will have stabilized, an
% \href{https://www.overleaf.com/}{overleaf} template will be made available for
% those without a \TeX~installation. If a \TeX~expert is ready to help review
% the template (and possibly rewrite it as a class), their help would be much
% welcome and appreciated. The same holds for LibreOffice, Word or Pages, any
% template is welcome, just contact us beforehand such that we can coordinate
% efforts.


% \subsubsection{Editorials, letters and special issues}

% ReScience C remains dedicated to the publication of computational replications
% but we (i.e., the editorial team) would like to have the opportunity to
% publish \emph{editorials} when deemed necessary and to give anyone the
% opportunity to write \emph{letters} to the community on a specific topic
% related to reproducibility. Both editorials and letters are expected to be 1 or
% 2 pages long (but no hard limit will be enforced), will be (quickly) peer reviewed,
% and will be assigned a DOI. Furthermore, with the advent of reproducibility
% hackatons worldwide, we will host {\em special issues} with guest editors (such
% as, for example, the organizers of a hackaton) in order to publish the results
% and to enhance their discoverability. Each entry will have to go through the
% regular open peer-reviewed pipeline.\\


% We hope that most readers will agree on the proposed changes such that we can
% commit to them in the next few weeks. The review for this editorial is open (as
% usual) and anyone can comment on and/or oppose any of the proposed changes. New
% ideas are also welcome.
