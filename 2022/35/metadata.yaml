# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "This reproducibility study aims to validate a claim regarding the impact of swear words on hate speech classification of African American English (AAE) text. We replicated the experiments using BERT models and a word replacement strategy on the Chameleon testbed. Our results broadly support the claim, showing that censored text (without swear words) is less frequently classified as hate speech. However, the choice of word replacement dictionary significantly influenced the results."
