abstract: "In this work we reproduce and extend the results presented in 'Quantifying Societal Bias Amplification in Image Captioning' by Hirota et al. This paper introduces LIC, a metric to quantify bias amplification by image captioning models, which is tested for gender and racial bias amplification. The original paper claims that this metric is robust, and that all models amplify both gender and racial bias. It also claims that gender bias is more apparent than racial bias, and the Equalizer variation of the NIC+ model increases gender but not racial bias. We repeat the measurements to confirm these claims. We extend the analysis to whether the method can be generalized to other attributes such as bias in age."
