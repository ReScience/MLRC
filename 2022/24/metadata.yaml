abstract: "In this work, we present our reproducibility study of 'Label-Free Explainability for Unsupervised Models',
           a paper that introduces two post‐hoc explanation techniques for neural networks: (1) label‐free feature
           importance and (2) label‐free example importance. Our study focuses on the reproducibility of the authors'
           most important claims: (i) perturbing features with the highest importance scores causes higherlatent
           shift than perturbing random pixels, (ii) label‐free example importance scores help to identify training
           examples that are highly related to a given test example, (iii) unsupervised models trained on different
           tasks show moderate correlation among the highest scored features and (iv) low correlation in example
           scores measured on a fixed set of data points, and (v) increasing the disentanglement with β in a β‐VAE
           does not imply that latent units will focus on more different features. We reviewed the authors' code,
           checked if the implementation of experiments matched with the paper, and also ran all experiments.
           The results are shown to be reproducible. Moreover, we extended the codebase in order to run
           the experiments on more datasets, and to test the claims with other experiments."
