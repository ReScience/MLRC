# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "Our work reproduced the critical findings of the paper
          Hyper-graph-Induced Semantic Tuplet(HIST) Loss for Deep Metric Learning and investigate 
          the effectiveness and robustness of HIST loss with the following five claims, which
          point that: (i) the proposed HIST loss performs consistently regardless of the batch size,
          (ii) regardless of the quantity of hyper-graph-neural-network(HGNN) layers L, the HIST
          loss shows consistent performance, (iii) the positive value of the scaling factor α of se‐
          mantic tuplets brings reliable performance for modeling semantic relations of samples,
          (iv) the large temperature parameter τ is effective; if τ >16, HIST loss is insensitive to the
          scaling parameter. and (v) the HIST loss contributes to achieving SOTA performances
          under the standard evaluation settings."
