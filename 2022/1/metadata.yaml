abstract: "G-Mixup is a novel data augmentation technique for graphs introduced by Han et al. We try to verify eight claims that the authors of G-Mixup make in their original paper by reproducing their experiments. The first two claims relate to the properties of graphons estimated from graphs, which are the main components of the method. Other claims relate to the superior performance of the method compared to other augmentation strategies."
