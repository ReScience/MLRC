# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "The original authors present CrossWalk, an edge-reweighting algorithm which can be used in conjunction with random walk based node representation learning methods. We validate their claims of CrossWalk being characterized by a fairness-enhancing property, meaning it significantly reduces disparity, a measure of group fairness, and performance-conserving property, meaning it has an insignificant effect on task performance."
