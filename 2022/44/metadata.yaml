# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "We examine the reproducibility of compositional generalization results from the task of semantic parsing. We aim to reproduce results from [1], [2], and [3] and seek to verify the claims that 1. A model shouldn’t be expected to perform well on non‐synthetic datasets just because it performs well on SCAN [1], 2. The approaches from [1] and [2] meet or exceed baseline performance on compositional generalization tests, and 3. NQG‐T5 [1] outperforms baselines on both synthetic and natural data. 4. NQG [1] performs well on the instances that it is able to generate a prediction, but it faces the barrier of not being able to generate predictions for all instances."
