abstract: "We examine the main claims of the original paper [1], which states that in an image classification task with imbalanced training data, (i) using pure noise to augment minority‐class images encourages generalization by improving minority-class accuracy. This method is paired with (ii) a new batch normalization layer that normalizes noise images using affine parameters learned from natural images, which improves the model’s performance. Moreover, (iii) this improvement is robust to varying levels of data augmentation. Finally, the authors propose that (iv) adding pure noise images can improve classification even on balanced training data."
