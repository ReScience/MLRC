abstract: "In this reproducibility study, we present our results and experience during replicating the paper, titled Exact Feature Distribution Matching for Arbitrary Style Transfer and Domain Generalization. In real-world scenarios, the feature distributions are mostly much more complicated than Gaussian, so only mean and standard deviation may not be fully representative to match them. This paper introduces a novel strategy to exactly match the histograms of image features via the Sort-Matching algorithm in a computationally feasible way. We were able to reproduce most of the results presented in the original paper both qualitatively and quantitatively."
