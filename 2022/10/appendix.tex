    \caption{Ten examples of CartoonX with a ViT with $\lambda k = 2, 10, 200$ are depicted in the two top, middle and bottom rows, respectively. Overall, with $\lambda k = 20$, most of the explanations are relatively sparse, with some explanations being completely black. With $\lambda k = 2$ there are no entirely black explanations. However, with this setting some explanations of images did not contain a lot of sparsity, i.e. did not show a clear explanation. Utilising  $\lambda k = 10$ constituted a suitable trade‚Äêoff between the explanations' sparsity and their expressiveness for most images.}
