\section{Full comparison Tables}

This appendix section is dedicated to Tables \ref{tab:fairness-full} and \ref{tab:predictive-equality-full} that compare all metrics provided in the original paper.
Because the results agree across all metrics, we deemed standard deviation the best metric to highlight the differences and similarities in variation.
