abstract: 'In this work, we attempt to reproduce the results of the NeurIPS 2022 paper "Towards Understanding Grokking: An Effective Theory of Representation Learning". This study shows that the training process can happen in four regimes: memorization, grokking, comprehension and confusion. We first try to reproduce the results on the toy example described in the paper and then switch to the MNIST dataset. Additionally, we investigate the consistency of phases depending on data and weight initialization and propose smooth phase diagrams for better visual perception.'
