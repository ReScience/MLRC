abstract: "Scope of Reproducibility:
           In this report, we aim to validate the claims of Bansal et al. These are that the recurrent 
           architecture presented, with skip connections and a progressive loss function, prevent the 
           original problem being forgotten or corrupted during processing allowing for the recurrent 
           module to be applied indefinitely and that this architecture avoids the overthinking trap. 
           We use both code released by the authors and newly developed to recreate many results 
           presented in the paper. Additionally, we present analysis of the newly introduced alpha 
           hyperparameter and investigate interesting perturbation behaviour of prefix sums models. 
           Further, we conduct a hyperparameter search and provide an analysis of the Asymptotic 
           Alignment scores of the models presented.

           Methodology:
           We use the PyTorch code released by the authors to replicate accuracy experiments. We then, 
           independently, develop our own PyTorchFI to replicate perturbation experiments presented by 
           Bansal et al. Overall, providing a replication of all results shown in the main body of the 
           paper. We then extend these results, providing an analysis of the alpha hyperparameter, 
           analysis of perturbation recovery, Asymptotic Alignment scores and a hyperparameter search. 
           We used both a Nvidia RTX 2080Ti GPU and sets of three NVIDIA Quadro RTX6000 GPUs, taking a 
           total of 982.2 GPU hours to create all results presented in the main body of this report.

           Results:
           We verify the authors' claims by replicating the experiments presented by Bansal et al. All 
           of our experiments show identical results to the ones presented in the paper, apart from 
           perturbation testing for which we provide an additional in depth analysis. We also provide an 
           analysis of the new alpha hyperparameter and a hyperparameter search.

           What was easy:
           The code provided by Bansal et al gave clear instructions on how to use it, along with 
           pretrained models being available for all problems.

           What was difficult:
           Chess models required a considerable amount of time to train, putting a drain on resources. 
           Also, code for reproducing perturbation results was not available so this had to developed 
           from scratch.

           Communication with original authors:
           We had good communication with the original authors, both emailing and meeting online."
