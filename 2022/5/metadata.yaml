# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "This report summarizes our efforts to reproduce the results presented
           in the ACL2021 paper Exploring the Representation of Word Meanings in
           Context: A Case Study on Homonymy and Synonymy by Marcos Garcia, as part
           of the ML Reproducibility Challenge 2022. The original author looks at
           both static and contextualized word embeddings to assess their ability
           to adequately represent different lexical-semantic relations, such as
           homonymy and synonymy. While the original paper describes experiments
           carried out on a number of contextualized and static models, we limit
           our reproducibility attempt to the results reported for BERT and fastText.
           Moreover, we extend the original work by compiling a new Italian dataset
           and report our findings for this additional resource.
           Despite being able to reproduce the original results only in part, the
           hypotheses formulated in the original paper are still corroborated."
