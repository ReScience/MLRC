abstract: "The main objective of the paper is to \"learn the Hamiltonian dynamics of simple physical systems from high-dimensional observations without restrictive domain assumptions\".
          To do so, the authors train a generative model that reconstructs an inputted sequence of images of the evolution of some physical system.
          For instance, they learn the dynamics of a pendulum, a body-spring system, and 2,3-bodies.
          In addition to these environments, we further expand the testing on two new environments and we explore architecture tweaks looking for performance gains."
