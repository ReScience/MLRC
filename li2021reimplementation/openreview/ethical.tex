\section{Ethical consideration}
The bias in the collected dataset is a serious problem when applying machine learning methods to the real-world scenarios. For example, applying machine learning methods to making automated decision-making systems for criminal prediction, university admission or recruitment. In these cases, we may very likely collect a dataset containing certain bias due to the historical reason or selection bias in the data collection process. If a model cannot deal with such bias in the dataset, it may inherit in the model by focusing on the unrelated or wrong relations in the dataset. Consequently, the model can make biased decision which can disadvantage a certain group of people and may even diminish this group in the society. 

Unfortunately, FixMatch cannot only be influenced by the noise in the label of a training dataset, but also it can make confirmation errors causing a biased model even when the dataset itself is unbiased. To deal with such issue, this work focuses on the asymmetric noise in the data labels and pseudo labels, which can lead to severe confirmation error and the biased model. And then, we applied different methods to reduce such noise in pseudo labels and reduce its impact on the model.
