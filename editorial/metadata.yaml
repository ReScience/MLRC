abstract: "The Fourth Editon of Reproducibility Challenge, ML Reproducibility Challenge 2020, is an open, peer-reviewed, collaborative experiment in evaluating Replicability and Reproducibility of Machine Learning articles accepted at top ML conferences in 2020, including NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, EMNLP, CVPR, ECCV. We conduct the challenge through Fall 2020 on accepted papers in this conference, and in this special issue of ReScience journal we present the peer-reviewed selected reports."
